Adds full Right-to-left (RTL) support to the Admin Area, Front-end, and Email Interface of WooCommerce.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce RTL** works by disabling the default *Left-to-right (LTR)* styles and replacing them with an optimized *Right-to-left (RTL)* version for:

* Admin Area *(Back-end)*.
* Shop Interface *(Front-end)*.

In addtion, the plugin overrides the main **Email Styles** to be *RTL-optimized*.

*WooCommerce RTL* is smart enough to not load these custom styles unless the current language WordPress is running is a *Right-to-left* one, such as **Arabic, Persian, and Urdu**.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip `woocommerce-rtl.zip`.
1. Upload `woocommerce-rtl` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
