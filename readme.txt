Adds full Right-to-left (RTL) support to the Admin Area, Front-end, and Email Interface of WooCommerce.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce RTL** works by disabling the default *Left-to-right (LTR)* styles and replacing them with an optimized *Right-to-left (RTL)* versions for:

* Admin Area *(Back-end)*.
* Shop Interface *(Front-end)*.
* Email Interface *(All email templates)*.

**CHECK OUT THE SCREENSHOTS OF THE PLUGIN TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES!**

**WooCommerce RTL** is smart enough to not load these custom styles unless the current language WordPress is running is a *Right-to-left* one, such as **Arabic, Persian, and Urdu**.

The main asset files will be updated each time WooCommerce gets a new upgrade. It will always stay up-to-date with the latest version of WooCommerce to ensure full compatibility.

**Currently compatible with version `2.3.7` of WooCommerce**

== Installation ==
